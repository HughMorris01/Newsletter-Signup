# Newsletter-Signup

This is a web application built along with Udemys Full Web Developer Course. 
It's built using Node.js and utilizes Mailchimps API to add contacts to an email list. The live application is hosted on Glitch located at:

There is currently no newsletter but hopefully the server returns a success page informing the user that they have in fact been added to the mailing list contained on mailchimp.
